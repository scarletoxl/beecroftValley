    dragon_keeper: {
        title: "The Last Dragon Keeper",
        text: `<p>Mira had always known she was different. While other children in the mountain village played with wooden swords, she spent her time watching the clouds, searching for shapes that might be more than clouds.</p>
<p>On the morning of her twelfth birthday, she found the egg. It was nestled in the hollow of an ancient oak tree, no bigger than her fist, its shell swirling with colours like oil on water. When she touched it, warmth spread through her fingers.</p>
<p>"You shouldn't have found that," said a voice behind her. Mira spun around to see an old woman she'd never noticed before. Her eyes were the same swirling colours as the egg.</p>
<p>"The dragon keepers died out a hundred years ago," the woman continued. "Or so everyone believed. But the dragons knew better. They've been waiting."</p>
<p>The old woman smiled, and for just a moment, Mira thought she saw scales shimmer beneath the wrinkled skin.</p>`

    time_garden: {
        title: "The Garden That Remembered",
        text: `<p>Nobody in Willowmere could explain the garden behind Mrs Chen's cottage. Flowers bloomed there that hadn't existed for centuries. Butterflies with wings like stained glass floated between plants that scientists said were extinct.</p>
<p>Twelve-year-old Kai discovered the truth by accident. He'd climbed the wall to retrieve his football and landed in a patch of luminous blue roses. The moment his skin touched a petal, memories flooded his mind — not his memories, but the garden's.</p>
<p>He saw the land before the town existed. He watched the first seed planted by a woman whose tears fell like rain. He felt centuries of growth, of seasons cycling, of roots reaching deep into earth that remembered everything.</p>
<p>"The garden keeps the world's forgotten things," Mrs Chen said, appearing beside him. "Every plant here grew from something that was lost. The blue roses? They grow from lost lullabies. The silver ferns remember languages no one speaks anymore."</p>
<p>Kai looked at his football. "What would grow from this?"</p>
<p>"From a child's game? Something wonderful. Something that laughs."</p>`

    lighthouse_ghost: {
        title: "The Lighthouse Keeper's Secret",
        text: `<p>When Maya's family moved to the old lighthouse, everyone warned them about the ghost. "She appears on stormy nights," they whispered. "A girl in a blue dress, forever waiting."</p>
<p>Maya didn't believe in ghosts until the first storm came. Lightning split the sky, and there she was — a translucent figure at the top of the spiral stairs, one hand reaching toward the light.</p>
<p>"I'm not trying to haunt anyone," the ghost said. "I'm trying to keep the light working. I've been doing it for a hundred and twelve years."</p>
<p>Her name was Eleanor. She'd been the lighthouse keeper's daughter in 1912. On the night of the great storm, she'd kept the light burning while her father was trapped in town. Seventeen ships made it to safety because of her.</p>
<p>"I made a promise," Eleanor explained. "As long as ships sail these waters, the light will never go dark." She smiled sadly. "I just didn't realise I'd have to keep it forever."</p>
<p>Maya reached for the light controls. "Maybe you don't have to do it alone anymore."</p>`

    paper_kingdom: {
        title: "The Kingdom of Folded Paper",
        text: `<p>The origami crane had been sitting on Li's windowsill for three years, a gift from her grandmother who had passed away. She never expected it to speak.</p>
<p>"Your grandmother asked me to wait," the crane said, its paper wings rustling. "She said you'd be ready when you turned eleven."</p>
<p>Ready for what? Li soon discovered. The crane led her to a world in the fold between dimensions — a kingdom made entirely of paper, where origami creatures lived and breathed.</p>
<p>Here, her grandmother had been a hero. As a young woman, she'd defended the Paper Kingdom from the Rain, a terrible force that threatened to dissolve everything. The people still told stories of her courage.</p>
<p>"She hoped you'd never need to know," the crane said. "But the Rain is returning. The kingdom needs a new champion."</p>
<p>Li looked at her hands — ordinary hands that had never held anything more dangerous than a pencil. But her grandmother had been ordinary once too.</p>`
    },
    
    clockwork_heart: {
        title: "The Clockwork Heart",
        text: `<p>In the city of Cogsworth, everything ran on clockwork — the trams, the streetlights, even the mechanical birds that sang at dawn. But eleven-year-old Finn had a secret: his own heart was clockwork too.</p>
<p>He'd been born with a weak heart, and his inventor father had replaced it with gears and springs when Finn was just a baby. Every night, Finn had to wind the key in his chest, or his heart would stop.</p>
<p>Nobody knew except his father. "People fear what they don't understand," his father had warned. "Keep your key hidden."</p>
<p>But when a fire trapped his classmates in the school basement, Finn faced a choice. The only way to break down the door was to use the powerful mainspring in his chest — the same spring that kept him alive.</p>
<p>As Finn felt his heart slowing, gears grinding, he smiled. His father had always said he had the biggest heart of anyone he knew. Today, Finn would prove him right.</p>
<p>He threw himself against the door.</p>`
    },
    
    mirror_twin: {
        title: "The Girl in the Mirror",
        text: `<p>Zoe had always avoided mirrors. When she was little, she'd convinced herself it was because she didn't like her reflection. But on her tenth birthday, she learned the truth.</p>
<p>The girl staring back at her blinked — when Zoe hadn't blinked at all.</p>
<p>"Finally," the reflection said. "I've been waiting years for you to notice."</p>
<p>Her name was Ezi — Zoe backwards — and she lived in the Mirror World, a place where everything was reversed. Left was right, up was down, and yesterday came after tomorrow.</p>
<p>"We used to be one person," Ezi explained. "But when you were born, our soul split in two. You got the real world. I got... this." She gestured at the backwards bedroom behind her.</p>
<p>Zoe pressed her palm against the glass. Ezi did the same. Their hands were identical but opposite, like puzzle pieces that would fit if the mirror weren't between them.</p>
<p>"I'm sorry," Zoe whispered.</p>
<p>"Don't be sorry," Ezi said. "Be ready. Because the barrier is breaking, and soon we'll need to face what split us apart in the first place."</p>`

    // ===== SCIENCE/NON-FICTION =====
    octopus_masters: {
        title: "Masters of Disguise: The Incredible Octopus",
        text: `<p>If you could have any superpower, you might want to consider those of the octopus. These remarkable sea creatures can change their colour, texture, and even shape in less than a second.</p>
<p>An octopus's skin contains thousands of special cells called chromatophores. Each cell is like a tiny bag of coloured pigment surrounded by muscles. When the muscles contract, the colour becomes visible. When they relax, it disappears.</p>
<p>But colour is only part of the trick. Octopuses can also change their skin texture from smooth to bumpy or spiky, allowing them to mimic coral, seaweed, or rocky surfaces. The mimic octopus can even impersonate other sea creatures like lionfish and sea snakes.</p>
<p>Scientists have discovered that octopuses are surprisingly intelligent. They can solve puzzles, open jars, and recognise individual human faces. In laboratory experiments, octopuses have learned to navigate mazes and remember solutions for months.</p>
<p>Perhaps most remarkably, octopuses have three hearts and blue blood. Two hearts pump blood to the gills, while the third pumps it to the rest of the body.</p>`
    },
    
    bee_world: {
        title: "The Secret World of Bees",
        text: `<p>Inside every beehive is a city of 50,000 workers, each with a specific job to do. From the moment a bee hatches, its role is determined by its age.</p>
<p>Young bees spend their first days as cleaners, polishing cells where new eggs will be laid. As they grow older, they become nurses, feeding larvae with royal jelly. Only after about three weeks do bees graduate to foraging.</p>

        text: `<p>At the top of the world, where winter temperatures drop below minus 50 degrees Celsius, survival requires extraordinary adaptations.</p>
<p>The Arctic fox has the warmest fur of any mammal. Its dense coat changes colour with seasons — white in winter to blend with snow, brown in summer to match rocky tundra.</p>
<p>Polar bears have solved the problem differently. Beneath their white-looking fur, their skin is actually black, helping absorb heat from the sun. Each hollow hair provides extra insulation.</p>
<p>Perhaps most impressive are Arctic ground squirrels. During hibernation, their body temperature drops to minus 3 degrees Celsius — the coldest of any mammal. Special proteins prevent ice crystals from forming in their blood.</p>
<p>Even plants have adapted. Arctic willows grow only a few centimetres tall, staying close to the ground where it's warmer. Some flowers can generate their own heat to melt surrounding snow.</p>`

<p>Not all volcanoes are the same. Shield volcanoes, like those in Hawaii, produce rivers of flowing lava that create gentle slopes. Stratovolcanoes, like Mount Fuji in Japan, are steeper and more explosive.</p>
<p>Scientists can often predict eruptions by watching for warning signs. Earthquakes beneath the volcano increase as magma pushes upward. The ground may swell like a balloon. Gases escaping through cracks change in composition.</p>
<p>Despite their dangers, volcanoes provide benefits. Volcanic soil is incredibly fertile. Volcanic rocks are used in construction. Geothermal energy from volcanic regions provides clean electricity for millions.</p>
<p>Iceland gets nearly 30% of its electricity from volcanic heat, using it to warm homes and generate power.</p>`

<p>Remember the wooden boat we started last summer? I finished painting it yesterday — bright red, just like you wanted. Tomorrow I'm taking it to Wilson's Pond to see if it floats. I'm a bit scared it might sink, but you always said the only real failure is not trying at all.</p>

<p>Founded by Ptolemy I, the library had an unusual collection method. Every ship arriving in Alexandria's harbour had to hand over any books on board. Scribes made copies, returning copies to the ships while keeping originals for the library.</p>
<p>At its peak, the library held between 400,000 and 700,000 scrolls. Scholars from across the Mediterranean came to study there. Euclid developed geometry within its walls. Eratosthenes calculated Earth's circumference.</p>
<p>The library's fate remains mysterious. There was no single destruction — it declined over centuries through fires, wars, and neglect. Some historians blame Julius Caesar's fire in 48 BCE.</p>

<p>Pumice — lightweight volcanic rock — began raining down. Initially, many residents stayed indoors, thinking they could wait out the storm. But the pumice kept falling at 15 centimetres per hour. Roofs began to collapse.</p>
<p>Those who fled early had the best chance of survival. Those who stayed faced pyroclastic surges — superheated clouds of gas and ash, reaching 300 degrees Celsius, sweeping down at 100 kilometres per hour.</p>

What is the flaw?", options: ["His brother knows nothing about footy", "Someone saying something does not make it true — he needs actual evidence", "He should ask his dad instead", "The team might actually be the best"], correct: 1, explanation: "Appeal to authority.

What is the problem?", options: ["She should use a different toothpaste", "Four dentists is far too small a sample to make a general claim", "Dentists do not know about toothpaste", "Three out of four is good enough"], correct: 1, explanation: "The sample size is too small. Asking only 4 dentists and claiming '3 out of 4 recommend it' is misleading. A proper survey needs many more responses." },

What is the flaw?", options: ["Plants cannot hear", "He did not compare it to a plant he did NOT talk to, so he cannot prove the talking helped", "5cm is not very much", "He should talk louder"], correct: 1, explanation: "No control group. Without comparing to a plant that was NOT talked to (but otherwise treated the same), he cannot prove talking made the difference. The plant might have grown 5cm anyway." },
    { question: "Jade says: 'I have never seen a kangaroo in my street, so kangaroos must be extinct.' What is wrong?", options: ["Kangaroos live in the bush, not in streets", "Not seeing something in one location does not prove it does not exist anywhere", "She should go to the zoo", "Kangaroos are not extinct"], correct: 1, explanation: "Absence of evidence is not evidence of absence. Not seeing kangaroos in her street does not mean they do not exist elsewhere." },
    { question: "Kai says: 'Our school team won more games this year after we changed our name. The new name must be luckier!' What is the flaw?", options: ["Names do not affect luck", "The name change and winning happened together, but the name did not cause the wins", "They should change it back to test", "The old name was fine"], correct: 1, explanation: "Correlation, not causation. The team might have improved due to better coaching, new players, or more practice — not because of a name change." },
    { question: "Lara says: 'My friend got stung by a bee at the park. Parks are dangerous places!' What is the flaw?", options: ["Parks are actually safe", "One bee sting at one park does not mean all parks are dangerous", "She should avoid bees", "Bees are not dangerous"], correct: 1, explanation: "Hasty generalisation. One negative experience at one park does not make all parks dangerous. Millions of people enjoy parks safely every day." },
    { question: "Mason picked 3 red balls from a bag and says: 'This bag must contain only red balls.' What is wrong?", options: ["He should pick more balls", "Drawing 3 red balls does not prove there are no other colours — he has not checked them all", "The bag is probably mixed", "Red is the most common colour"], correct: 1, explanation: "Hasty generalisation. Just because the first 3 were red does not mean the bag contains only red balls. There could be other colours he has not drawn yet." },
    { question: "Nina says: 'I scored 100% on my spelling test after eating chocolate, so chocolate makes you smarter.' What is the flaw?", options: ["Chocolate is bad for you", "Eating chocolate and scoring well happened together, but one did not cause the other", "She should eat more chocolate to confirm", "100% means she already knew the words"], correct: 1, explanation: "Correlation, not causation. Nina scored well because she knew the words, not because of chocolate. Two things happening at the same time does not prove one caused the other." },

What colour is Sam's hat?", options: ["Red", "White", "Blue", "Cannot tell"], correct: 3, explanation: "Rex cannot have red or white, so Rex has blue. Sam cannot have blue.
